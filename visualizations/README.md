This folder contains separate datasets for each visualization on the NYC Health Department's Childhood Vaccination Data Explorer. Oldest datasets are no longer displayed for visualizations (older than eight years for trends on routine vaccination series and five years for all other visualizations).

Vaccination coverages with numerators COUNT_PEOPLE_VAC less than 10 (9 or fewer) are suppressed and not shown due to small numbers. Vaccination coverages with denominators less than 50 should be interpreted with caution due to small population estimates.
